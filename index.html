      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>

        awful puns that you would never
        make otherwise, so we did it for you!</p>

      <p>Our founder AJ said this as he formulated 
        the idea for this website. We had the idea
        to make this website a <b>scam</b>, but he told
        us to do otherwise. Without him, we might be 
        conning your na&iuml;ve, sweet, mother out of all her

        Anyone?<br>Aww... 
        Well, enjoy the site, as we  
        <q>definitely</q>
        spent a <q>ton</q> of money and effort making it!</p>
