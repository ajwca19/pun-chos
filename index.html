        <h2>Our Purpose</h2> <hr>
        <p>This site is dedicated to
        making horrible, terrible, just
        awful puns that you would never
        make otherwise, so we did it for you!</p>
        <div class="quote"><blockquote>Well, I've already made a couple
        terrible puns to go on this site, and I'm definitely
        making more, so <strong>here you go, internet!</strong></blockquote></div>
        <p>Our founder AJ said this as he formulated 
        the idea for this website. We had the idea
        to make this website a <b>scam</b>, but he told
        us to do otherwise. Without him, we might be 
        conning your na&iuml;ve, sweet, mother out of all her

        spent a <q>ton</q> of money and effort making it!</p>
